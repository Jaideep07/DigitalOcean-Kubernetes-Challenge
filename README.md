# DigitalOcean-Kubernetes-Challenge
### Deploying an internal container registry
Since kubernetes does not provide an internal container registry but having one would be really useful, therefore we are going to deploy a container registry to our kubernetes using [Harbour](https://goharbor.io/docs/2.4.0/install-config/).
### Before proceeding to our challenge lets understand some keywords:
#### [Container image](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/):
A container image is a ready-to-run software package, containing everything needed to run an application: the code and any runtime it requires, application and system libraries, and default values for any essential settings.
#### [Container registry](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-a-container-registry):
A container registry is a repository, or collection of repositories, used to store container images for Kubernetes, DevOps,  and container-based application development.
#### [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/):
Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available. <br><br>
The image shows container evolution, Kubernetes helps in orchestration of modern containers.

#### [HELM](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/kubernetes-helm-charts/)
Helm helps us to manage Kubernetes applications â€” Helm Charts help us define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.
### Continuing with the challenge:
I am going to use my local Linux terminal to deploy clusters and etc. check out [this](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/) to install DigitalOcean CLI and authenticate your local terminal with its API. { I have already authenticated my terminal, so before going to step 1, refer the above link and auth. your digitalocean CLI }
#### Step 1 : Setting up kubernetes cluster on [DigitalOcean](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/reference/kubernetes/cluster/create/)
Go to your local terminal and type in the following command and set the flags according to your requirement. This could take few minutes for the kubernetes cluster to get provisioned and get running. <br>
`doctl kubernetes cluster create kube-challenge --version 1.21.5-do.0 --count 1 --size s-1vcpu-2gb --region blr1` <br>
Now install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/) which helps as to operate over our kubernetes cluster.
